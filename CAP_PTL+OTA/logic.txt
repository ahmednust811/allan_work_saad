here is the logic of the program at the moment:
1. start the AP mode in APSTA and HTTP server
2. check for wifi creds in NVS 
	if found:
		check if the last created token expired or not
		if expired:
			check if any token exists in nvs or not 
				if not:
					make a JWT signed by the private key
				else: 
					skip the jwt making process
		if not expired:
			skip the jwt making process
		send queue message after token is created
	if not found:
		wait for credentials from web server
		reboot on getting the creds and save them to nvs
3. when queue message recieved from jwt process 
	check if new jwt was created successfully
		if sucessfully created:
			over rride the default jwt 
		else:
			use default jwt made from jwt.io
	check if config exists in nvs:
		if exists:
			skip the request part and return 
		if not exists:
			download from link 
			and save to nvs 


----CONFUSIONS:
	DO WE NEED TO UPDATE THE JWT AGAIN AND AGAIN OR WE ONLY NEED TO DO SO ON REBOOT AND IF AND ONLY IF THE JWT IS EXPIRED
